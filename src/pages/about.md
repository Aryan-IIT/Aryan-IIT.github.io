<p>
	I'm currently pursuing a major in Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar. I like to work extensively in machine learning, data science, and software engineering. I am aspirational about all kinds of tech businesses.  
</p>

<p>
	Summer 2026, I shall be interning with Goldman Sachs as a Summer Analyst in Engineering. 
</p>

<p>
	I am also an undergraduate researcher, presently working in the domain of hardware accelerators and ML at nanoDC Lab, IIT Gandhinagar. Previously, I have interned in Data Science, GenAI (Language) and Software.  
</p>

<p>
	I was also involved in my college's Technical Summit, Amalthea, where I served as the Finance and Admin Coordinator. This experience has taught me the value of soft skills and people management in life.  
</p>

<p>
	I value personal growth and learning new things, with the prime objective of helping others (and myself) reach their truest potential. I like to play the drums, swim, and try out new foods. I oscillate between Mumbai and Gandhinagar and am a sucker for conversations over chai, be it on transformers or desi hip hop, feel free to reach out!
